# Eat Da Burger!

Welcome to the burger creating and eating app. This app allows you to create, eat, and keep track of burgers using an SQL database.

## Experience

Upon loading the page, the user will see a list on the left containing a few burgers that have been created beforehand but haven't been eaten yet. On the right will be a list of burgers that have already been eaten. At the bottom of the page there will be a small form for the user to type in their own burger creations and add them to the list of uneaten burgers.
